# Updating David Mackay's 'Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air'

A temporary repo to explore moving Prof David Mackay's book into a wiki and update it.

## TODO - allow others to run this locally

Allow for someone to run this repo locally.  Currently it has been copied from
within a larger Vike application used to produce the [ajamesphillips.com](https://ajamesphillips.com/) website.

It would be good to allow others to run this site on their machines locally and
contribute to it.
